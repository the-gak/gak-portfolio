In our previous example, we used a GET call to retrieve information. But APIs can do more than retrieve information, which is why the server needs to know your intention when you're communicating with it.

This is where HTTP methods come in. Here are some of the most common HTTP methods you'll come across:

* **GET** - This method is used to retrieve information from the server.
* **POST** - This method is used to send information to the server. For example, whenever you fill an online form and click **Submit**, this type of API call would be sent to the website's server.
* **PUT** - This method is used to update information on the server. For example, whenever you edit your account information in an app, this type of API call would be used.
* **DELETE** - This method is used to delete information on the server.

There are other methods that are used in specific situations. If you're interested, you can [learn more about them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods).
